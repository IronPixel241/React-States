## Introduction

State management is a core concept in React that allows you to create dynamic and interactive web applications. This repository is designed to provide you with hands-on examples and practice exercises to improve your understanding of React states.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples in this repository, you need to have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-states-learning.git
   cd react-states-learning
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the examples in action.

## Code Examples

### useState

The `useState` hook is the most basic way to manage state in a functional component. It allows you to add state to your functional components and re-render them when the state changes.

Example:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

### useEffect

The `useEffect` hook allows you to perform side effects in your functional components. It runs after the first render and after every update.

Example:
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Timer() {
  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setSeconds(seconds => seconds + 1);
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  return <div>Seconds: {seconds}</div>;
}

export default Timer;
```

### useReducer

The `useReducer` hook is used for more complex state logic where the state depends on previous state values. It is often used as an alternative to `useState`.

Example:
```jsx
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

### Context API

The Context API allows you to share state across your application without having to pass props down manually at every level.

Example:
```jsx
import React, { useState, useContext, createContext } from 'react';

const CountContext = createContext();

function Counter() {
  const { count, setCount } = useContext(CountContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <CountContext.Provider value={{ count, setCount }}>
      <Counter />
    </CountContext.Provider>
  );
}

export default App;
```
